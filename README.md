# ASL-Gesture-detection
Everyone deserves to be understood, but sign language's importance is often overlooked in the society. This application aims to help rectify this by providing an ASL gesture detection system. The application uses mediapipe, tensorflow and deep learning to make a real time detector which detects common ASL gestures such as 'hello', 'thank you' etc. It may be updated in the future to also detect the alphabets of not just ASL, but also other sign languages.
