# ASL-Gesture-detection
This application aims to help rectify this by providing an ASL gesture detection system. The app can be used to (at the moment) translate American Sign Language into English, making communication easier for signers. The detector is real-time and gives effective and accurate results. One may also use this application to practice sign language to improve and learn sign language gestures. This app makes signers feel more able in their community while teaching the community about this complex and necessary expression. 

The app has future updates planned, including adding other sign languages (and their common gestures!), making the app more user friendly by adding a website and an easier interface and adding more education tools to practice and learn. It was a very informative, fun and challenging internship, and I learned a lot over these three months. I can't wait to see what comes next! 

Here are some user-interface pictures!
